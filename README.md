# Developing-a-Regressor
Columbia Machine Learning Homework

Welcome to Spring 2022 large-scale regression task. Your goal for this assignment is to develop a good quality regressor for the given dataset.

The given dataset comes from a Uber-esque transportation service. It consists of about 400000 rides taken by users. The task is to predict the duration (in seconds) of the ride.

Your primary goal for this assignment is to develop a good quality trip-duration predictor. (This of course will be only possible if you employ good Machine Learning practices).
