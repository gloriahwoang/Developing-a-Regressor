# Developing-a-Regressor
Columbia Machine Learning Homework

Welcome to Spring 2022 large-scale regression task. Your goal for this assignment is to develop a good quality regressor for the given dataset.

The given dataset comes from a Uber-esque transportation service. It consists of about 400000 rides taken by users. The task is to predict the duration (in seconds) of the ride.

Your primary goal for this assignment is to develop a good quality trip-duration predictor. (This of course will be only possible if you employ good Machine Learning practices).

You must get a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Score of at most 500 on the private holdout test-dataset to get full credit.


# My Submission

My final MAE was 493.82080. 
For this assignment, I standardized my data and used PCA to reduce the data dimensionality. Then I developed a Linear Regression Model.
